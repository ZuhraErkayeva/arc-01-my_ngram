# Welcome to My Ngram
 ***My-Ngram***

## Task

I didn't have many problems. There were minor problems, but I solved them with the help of my teacher.

## Description

I solved the problem with my teacher. The teacher helped me with my Ngram project after class and I got help from Google. He helped me solve the problems I was missing.

## Installation

No installation. My ngram doesn't have any settings, I start the setup with gcc my_ngram.c. After that I fix any errors and then run it with ./a.exe.

## Usage

gcc my_ngram.c; ./a.exe Hello; 



It works with running: make (and then) ./a.exe [some text]
